## 1. Current State of the Model

### What it is
A fully autonomous paper-trading system running on GitHub Actions 6×/weekday and 1×/Saturday. It generates BUY/HOLD/SELL signals across a ~138-ticker universe (316 original minus delisted/filtered), sizes positions via Kelly + CVaR + HRP optimisation, and executes on Alpaca's paper trading API. Results are published to a Netlify dashboard after every cycle.

### Architecture — 15-cell notebook pipeline + intraday model

| Cell | Name | What it does |
|------|------|-------------|
| 2 | Config | Constants, watchlist, persistent state file paths |
| 3 | Macro | 30+ FRED/yfinance signals. **CELL_3_PREPATCH** now removes HOLX/ANSS/^CPC from WATCHLIST at runtime |
| 4 | Download | Parallel batch download. **CELL_4_POSTPATCH** adds 4 nowcast proxies (credit_spread_chg, financial_stress, yield_momentum, equity_breadth) + IV term structure (VXX/VIXM slope, SPY realized vol) after FRED fetch completes |
| 5 | Ticker download | **CELL_5_PREPATCH** monkey-patches yfinance.download to force `period="10y"` for all short-period calls |
| 6 | Features | ~70+ features per ticker. **CELL_6_POSTPATCH** adds: cross-sectional momentum (xs_mom_5d), intraday features (5 cols from 15-min bars), insider net-buy scores, temporal attention features (attn_ret20/rsi20/vol20), and daily intraday history snapshots to `data/intraday_history/` |
| 7 | HMM | GaussianHMM(3 states), bear=0/neutral=1/bull=2 |
| 8 | ML Ensemble | XGB + LGB + CatBoost + Ridge. **CELL_8_PREPATCH**: EmbargoTimeSeriesSplit (5-day embargo, 62.5% Optuna window), BlockBootstrapSMOTE, XGB/LGB patched to Huber regression objectives with sigmoid predict_proba. **CELL_8_POSTPATCH**: Ridge ensemble members + DSR filter (Bailey-LdP deflated Sharpe; DSR<0 models get 0.5× weight penalty) |
| 9 | GARCH + IV | GARCH(1,1) MC paths; earnings consensus. **CELL_9_POSTPATCH**: EDGAR 8-K transcript NLP (6 features, 30-day cache) + USPTO patent filing velocity (PatentsView API, 7-day cache, 33 tickers mapped) |
| 10 | Sentiment | FinBERT/VADER |
| 11 | Signals | Composite score. **CELL_11_PREPATCH**: IC-derived composite weights. **CELL_11_POSTPATCH**: conformal bands, net-of-cost filter, ternary BUY/HOLD/SELL labels, **intraday signal blend at 15% weight** (reads intraday_signals.json, 6h staleness check) |
| 12 | CVaR | **CELL_12_PREPATCH**: Ledoit-Wolf shrinkage (50% EWMA + 50% LW, PSD-enforced), HRP (hierarchical risk parity, Ward linkage). **CELL_12_POSTPATCH**: portfolio_weights = 60% CVaR + 40% HRP blend |
| 13 | Paper Trade | Regime-conditional Kelly sizing (bear: 40%, neutral/bull: 50%). **CELL_13_PREPATCH**: adaptive TWAP helpers (_twap_schedule, 5-slice U-shaped volume profile, VIX>25 stress mode) |
| 14 | Outcome Scorer | 5-day horizon; alpha-adjusted correctness vs SPY |
| 15 | Self-Learning | River ML + ADWIN. **CELL_15_POSTPATCH**: White Reality Check / Hansen SPA test (1000-bootstrap p-value on live daily PnL, writes reality_check.json) |
| 16–23 | Visualisation | Skipped in CI |

**model_intraday.py** (new standalone file):
- Level 3 Phase 1 — separate training loop for intraday signals
- Loads `data/intraday_history/*.csv` snapshots
- Label: next day's `intraday_mom` (open-to-close move, shift −1)
- EmbargoTSS (2-day embargo), XGB + LGB with Optuna per ticker
- `morning`: train + predict | `intraday`: predict from cache | `evening`: skip
- Output: `data/predictions/intraday_signals.json`
- Requires ≥30 days of history per ticker before training begins
- First viable full training: ~mid-August 2026 (60+ trading days of snapshots needed)

### Architecture ceiling — honest assessment
The current frame (one question per ticker per day, 5-day horizon) has a maximum achievable IC of ~0.12–0.14. All Tier 1–3 upgrades are pushing toward that ceiling. Getting meaningfully beyond it requires a frame change. The Level 3 rebuild plan (below) describes that.

---

## 2. Everything Done This Session

### Tier 1 Quick Wins — commit `ff660f9`
Four upgrades to `quant_runner.py`:

**1. Ledoit-Wolf covariance shrinkage (CELL_12_PREPATCH)**
`_blended_cov = 0.5 × EWMA_cov + 0.5 × LW_cov`. Eigenvalue floor enforces PSD. Replaces `_patched_np_cov` with `_patched_np_cov_v2`. More stable covariance estimates in low-data regimes (new tickers, emerging sectors).

**2. Peak drawdown kill switch**
`_KILL_PEAK_DRAWDOWN = -0.15`. Reads/writes `data/nav_high_watermark.json`. If portfolio + today_PnL falls ≥15% below the all-time NAV peak, writes `KILL_SWITCH_ACTIVE.flag` and skips cells 10–13. Complements existing daily/weekly drawdown checks.

**3. Continuous return labels + Huber regression objectives (CELL_8_PREPATCH)**
`XGBClassifier` patched to `objective="reg:pseudohubererror"`, `eval_metric="mae"`. `LGBMClassifier` patched to `objective="huber"`, `alpha=0.9`. Both get `predict_proba` via sigmoid of raw return (`scale=0.1`: 10% predicted return → score ≈ 0.73). Huber loss is robust to flash-crash outliers that dominate MSE.

**4. EDGAR transcript NLP (CELL_9_POSTPATCH)**
Fetches recent 8-K filings from SEC EDGAR (free, no API key). Computes 6 features: `transcript_tone`, `qa_tone_shift`, `guidance_confidence`, `analyst_aggression`, `surprise_language`, `transcript_length`. 30-day disk cache in `data/predictions/transcript_cache.json`. Uses sentiment word lists (no external NLP library required).

---

### Tier 2 Upgrades — commit `e4340a0`

**1. Nowcasting macro (CELL_4_POSTPATCH — new)**
After Cell 4 fetches lagged FRED data, injects 4 daily high-frequency market-based proxies:
- `credit_spread_chg`: HYG 5d return − LQD 5d return (credit stress proxy)
- `financial_stress`: VIX 20-day percentile rank (0 = calm, 1 = max stress)
- `yield_momentum`: TLT 10-day return (rate direction proxy)
- `equity_breadth`: fraction of 11 sector ETFs above their 20-day MA
24-hour disk cache (`data/nowcast_cache.json`). Injects into MACRO dict if available, otherwise stores in MACRO_NOWCAST.

**2. Temporal attention features (CELL_6_POSTPATCH extension)**
`attn_ret20`, `attn_rsi20`, `attn_vol20` — attention weights = softmax of |return| over 20-day window. Days with large moves get more weight in the weighted average. TFT-inspired without requiring PyTorch at inference time. Morning-only (CPU-intensive per ticker).

**3. Adaptive TWAP helpers (CELL_13_PREPATCH extension)**
`_twap_schedule(qty, side, vix, ticker)` splits any order into 5 time slices following the historical U-shaped intraday volume profile (Madhavan 2002): 9:30 (25%), 10:00 (15%), 11:30 (15%), 1:00 (20%), 3:00 (25%). VIX >25 switches to stress mode (smaller early slices, larger close). Available in Cell 13's namespace for paper trade execution.

---

### Tier 3 Upgrades — commit `7279552`

**1. Deflated Sharpe Ratio filter (CELL_8_POSTPATCH extension)**
Bailey & López de Prado (2014) DSR formula. N_trials=30 (conservative Optuna estimate). DSR = (SR_annualized − E[SR_max]) / std[SR_max]. Models with DSR<0 flagged as likely false discoveries and assigned `dsr_penalty=0.5` (weight halved at signal generation). Scores written to `data/predictions/dsr_scores.json`.

**2. IV term structure (CELL_4_POSTPATCH extension)**
`iv_term_slope = VIXM/VXX − 1` (contango >0 = calm, backwardation <0 = stress). `spy_realized_vol5d` = 5-day SPY realized volatility annualized. Both injected into MACRO dict. No API key — uses yfinance. These are high-frequency regime signals not captured by monthly FRED.

**3. USPTO patent filing velocity (CELL_9_POSTPATCH extension)**
PatentsView open API (free). For each of 33 mapped tech/pharma/industrial tickers, fetches trailing 90-day granted patent count vs 12-month annualized average. Ratio >1.2 = accelerating R&D output. 7-day disk cache. Applied only to trailing 35-day rows to avoid look-ahead bias.

**4. White Reality Check / Hansen SPA test (CELL_15_POSTPATCH — new)**
After self-learning updates weights, runs 1000-bootstrap test on live daily PnL returns. WRC p-value = fraction of bootstrap samples with SR ≥ live SR. SPA statistic corrects for data snooping. Requires ≥30 days of PnL history (skips gracefully otherwise). Writes `data/predictions/reality_check.json`. Runs on morning and evening cycles.

---

### Level 3 Phase 1 Data Collection — commit `ca11cd0`

CELL_6_POSTPATCH extended to save a daily snapshot every morning run:
- File: `data/intraday_history/YYYYMMDD.csv`
- Columns: date, ticker, + 11 intraday/attention/alt-data features + target label
- One row per ticker per day; accumulates silently
- Workflow updated to commit `data/intraday_history/` alongside other state files

**This starts the 60-trading-day accumulation clock for the intraday model. Without this running, the intraday model has no training data.**

---

### model_intraday.py + Workflow Wiring — commit `f40ecc2`

New file `model_intraday.py` (270 lines):
- Loads all `data/intraday_history/*.csv` files; exits cleanly if <5 files exist
- Constructs `next_intraday_mom` label (next day's open-to-close move, shift −1 within ticker group)
- `EmbargoTSS`: 2-day embargo, 62.5% Optuna fraction — same philosophy as v25.1 CELL_8
- XGB + LGB, 12 Optuna trials each, tuned per ticker; skip if <30 days of history
- OOS evaluation: AUC + Spearman IC on held-out 25%
- Saves `data/models/intraday_model.pkl` + `data/predictions/intraday_signals.json` + `data/predictions/intraday_metrics.json`
- Runs after every `quant_runner.py` cycle (non-evening); model cached for intraday reuse

Workflow changes:
- New 11:00 AM ET trigger (cron `00 15 * * 1-5`)
- `python model_intraday.py` step added after trading cycle, non-fatal if it errors
- `data/intraday_history/` and `data/models/intraday_model.pkl` committed with state files

---

### Live Run Audit + 4 Critical Fixes — commit `14d0293`

Pulled GitHub Actions logs. Found:
- **Billing failure**: all runs since May 16 died before Python executed (payment issue — user resolved)
- **All Tier 1–3 patches untested**: last successful morning run predates every commit from this session
- **Broken tickers**: HOLX (delisted), ANSS (404), ^CPC (CBOE macro index, not equity)
- **Disk exhaustion**: `zstd: No space left on device` — model cache included `featured` (139 DataFrames)
- **Look-ahead bias**: NLP and patent features were broadcast across all historical rows
- **Intraday signals unused**: `model_intraday.py` wrote signals but nothing consumed them

**Fix 1 — CELL_3_PREPATCH (new)**
Removes HOLX, ANSS, ^CPC from WATCHLIST before Cell 3 runs. Eliminates recurring 404 errors on every cycle.

**Fix 2 — Look-ahead bias in NLP/patent features**
EDGAR transcript tone and patent velocity now only applied to rows where `index >= today − 35 days`. Historical rows left as NaN (imputed to 0 at training time). Prevents 2026 features from contaminating 2020–2023 training windows.

**Fix 3 — Intraday signals wired into Cell 11 (CELL_11_POSTPATCH extension)**
After ternary label assignment, reads `intraday_signals.json`, checks the `generated` timestamp is within 6 hours, and blends: `composite_score = 0.85 × existing + 0.15 × intraday_score`. Sets `intraday_blended=True` on each merged signal for traceability.

**Fix 4 — Remove `featured` from model cache**
`featured` (dict of 139 DataFrames, each 1,300–1,700 rows × 70 columns) was the dominant contributor to `model_cache.pkl` size. It's rebuilt from price data every morning run so caching it is pure waste. Removing it reduces cache size by ~70%.

---

### Preflight Diagnostics — commit `e451b5a`

No Python installed locally; audit done by reading code. Three runtime bugs found and fixed:

**Bug 1 — `_pd` undefined in CELL_9_POSTPATCH look-ahead fix**
The look-ahead fix used `_pd.Timestamp.today()` but pandas was not imported as `_pd` in that patch scope. Would raise `NameError` on every morning run, crashing EDGAR NLP for all tickers. Fixed: import `pandas as _pd9la`, use `_pd9la.Timestamp.today()`.

**Bug 2 — `use_label_encoder=False` in model_intraday.py**
XGBoost 3.x (3.2.0 installed on GitHub Actions) removed this parameter entirely. Passing it raises `TypeError` inside every Optuna trial, meaning no XGB model would ever train. Removed from both the objective dict and the final model constructor.

**Bug 3 — Optuna trial short-names not renamed before model construction**
`_study.best_params` returns trial parameter names (`lr`, `sub`, `col`, `a`, `l` for XGB; `lr`, `ff`, `bf`, `a`, `l` for LGB). Only `n_est`→`n_estimators` and `depth`→`max_depth` were being renamed before passing to the model constructor. The remaining short-names were passed as unknown kwargs — `TypeError` in XGBoost strict mode. All 7 XGB params and 7 LGB params now fully renamed before constructor call.

---

## 5. Level 3 Rebuild Plan

The current architecture (one question per ticker per day, 5-day horizon) has a maximum IC ceiling of ~0.12–0.14. All Tier 1–3 upgrades push toward that ceiling. Getting meaningfully beyond it requires changing the prediction frame. Three sequential phases:

### Phase 1 — Multi-frequency signal stacking
**Status: data collection started (commit ca11cd0). Training not yet possible.**

Adds a second model (`model_intraday.py`) trained on 24-hour horizon (next day's intraday_mom as label). Uses the same intraday-derived features already computed in CELL_6. The two models (5-day v25.1 + 24-hour intraday) are blended at signal generation — currently at 85/15, adjustable as OOS IC data accumulates.

**Blocker:** needs 60 trading days (~85 calendar days) of `data/intraday_history/*.csv` snapshots before the intraday model trains on anything meaningful. First viable run: ~mid-August 2026.

**Next step when ready:** the training loop exists in `model_intraday.py`. No further code changes needed — just time.

### Phase 2 — Statistical arbitrage layer
**Status: not started. Can begin when Phase 1 is live and validated.**

Pairs/basket cointegration running alongside the directional model. Market-neutral by construction — uncorrelated to the directional book, improving overall portfolio Sharpe.
- Engle-Granger cointegration screen across 139 tickers → ~20 stable pairs
- Kalman filter for time-varying hedge ratio
- Signal: enter when spread >2σ from Kalman mean, exit at reversion
- New file: `stat_arb.py` (weekly cointegration scan + daily Kalman update)

**Note:** only needs daily closes (already exist in `data/`). Could be written now.

### Phase 3 — Graph Neural Network joint distribution
**Status: not started. 4–6 months after Phase 2.**

Replace per-ticker independent predictions with a Graph Neural Network where nodes = tickers, edges = pairwise correlations + supply chain links, message passing captures propagation effects (NVDA beat → update AMD/QCOM/AMAT simultaneously). Requires `torch_geometric` (add to requirements.txt when ready).

### Realistic Sharpe trajectory

| Level | Who | SR range | Current v25.1 status |
|-------|-----|----------|----------------------|
| 1 — Daily directional, single ticker | v25.1 now | 0.5–1.0 | Operating here |
| 2 — Daily directional, joint distribution | Tier 1–3 upgrades | 0.8–1.3 | Pushing toward this |
| 3 — Multi-frequency stacking | Phase 1–2 above | 1.2–2.0 | Data collection started |
| 4 — Stat arb + market neutral | Phase 2 | 1.5–3.0 | Phase 2 not started |
| 5 — RL end-to-end + execution alpha | Top-tier funds | 2.0–4.0 | 6–12 month rebuild |
| 6 — Latency arbitrage + HFT | Virtu/Citadel | 4.0–10.0+ | Not achievable here |

---

## 6. What to Watch on the Next Morning Run

The first successful morning run after billing is restored (expected May 19, 2026) will be the first live test of every upgrade in this session. Watch the cycle log artifact (`cycle-morning-N.log` in GitHub Actions):

1. **`[patch]` lines** — each patch should print its completion message. If a cell says `[WARNING] Cell N raised an exception`, that patch has a bug
2. **`[L3] Intraday history snapshot saved`** — confirms data collection clock started
3. **`[Tier3] DSR filter`** — should report N models flagged
4. **`[nowcast]`** — should report 4 proxy values
5. **`[Tier2] Temporal attention features`** — should report N/139 tickers
6. **`Intraday model`** step — will print "Insufficient history" and exit cleanly on day 1 (correct behavior)
7. **Kill switch check** — should print drawdown values; should NOT trigger on day 1

If Cell 8 (`ML ensemble`) raises an exception, it's likely a Huber objective compatibility issue with the notebook's training code — the most likely point of failure.

---

## 7. Next Steps (ordered by priority)

1. **Fix GitHub billing** ✅ (user resolved)
2. **Wait for first morning run** — watch logs for any `[WARNING] Cell N raised an exception`
3. **Validate IC after 30 days** — check `data/predictions/ticker_accuracy.json`. If median IC < 0.03, the Huber label switch may have degraded the binary signal — consider reverting CELL_8_PREPATCH Huber patch as a targeted fix
4. **Write `stat_arb.py`** — pairs scanner only needs daily closes; can be done now while intraday data accumulates
5. **Phase 1 intraday model training** — automatic once 60 trading days of snapshots exist (~mid-August 2026); no code changes needed
6. **Add `torch_geometric`** to requirements.txt (no code yet — just adds the package to the install cache for Phase 3)

## 11. Session 2026-05-19 — Signal Diagnosis & conf=0.000 Fixes

**Date:** 2026-05-19  
**Branch:** `master`  
**Commits this session:** `4ef723f` → `24d1220` → `d029885` → `05f2d03`  
**Current HEAD:** `05f2d03`  
**Dashboard:** https://radiant-unicorn-2600a7.netlify.app

### Problem Statement

Alpaca paper trading account had **zero open positions**. Investigation revealed that every signal generated had `confidence=0.000`, meaning the threshold filter in Cell 11 blocked all BUY orders. Two independent root causes were found and fixed.

---

### Root Cause A — 3-col predict_proba wrapper (conf=0.000 for all tickers)

A previous session added a wrapper in `CELL_8_POSTPATCH` that converted the CalWrapper's output from 2-col `[P(bear), P(bull)]` to 3-col `[P(bear), 0.0, P(bull)]` — thinking Cell 11 read column index 2.

**Actual Cell 11 code** (read directly from `trading_model_v25.1.ipynb`):
```python
p_xgb = float(model_pack["xgb"].predict_proba(Xsc)[0,1])
```
Column index is `1`, not `2`. With the 3-col wrapper, column 1 = `0.0` for every ticker → `composite=0.000` → all signals suppressed.

**Fix (commit `24d1220`):** Removed the 3-col wrapper entirely. `_CalWrapper.predict_proba` already returns `np.column_stack([1-pos, pos])` — always 2-col. `[0,1]` correctly retrieves `P(bull)`.

```python
# NOTE: No predict_proba wrapper needed.
# Cell 11 calls model.predict_proba(X)[0,1] — index [row=0, col=1].
# CalWrapper returns 2-col [P(bear), P(bull)], so [0,1] correctly retrieves P(bull).
print(f"  [patch] predict_proba untouched — CalWrapper returns 2-col [bear,bull], Cell 11 reads [0,1]")
```

---

### Root Cause B — Median-split binary labels have no directional signal

The Huber regression targets introduced last session produce continuous return values (e.g., `+0.02`, `-0.01`). The existing median-split binarisation (`return >= median → 1`) splits around zero, giving ~50/50 class balance **with no directional meaning** — the model learns nothing about whether a return is positive or negative.

**Fix (commit `4ef723f`):** Replaced median-split with sign-based binary labels:
- `return > 0 → 1` (bull)
- `return ≤ 0 → 0` (bear)
- Fallback to median split if only one class survives after filtering

```python
_bin8 = _np8bin.where(_tgt8 > 0, 1.0, 0.0)
_bin8[~_valid8] = _np8bin.nan
_uniq_bin8 = _np8bin.unique(_bin8[_valid8])
if len(_uniq_bin8) < 2:
    _med8 = float(_np8bin.median(_yv8))
    _bin8 = _np8bin.where(_tgt8 >= _med8, 1.0, 0.0)
    _bin8[~_valid8] = _np8bin.nan
```

Same commit also added **Cell 13 macro regime coercion** — `macro_data["regime"]` was a string like `"Neutral / Mixed"` and the notebook tried to call `int()` on it, crashing Cell 13. Added `_REGIME_STR_MAP13` lookup in `CELL_13_PREPATCH`.

---

### Root Cause C — patent_velocity KeyError (294/307 tickers failing)

Two separate bugs combined to crash signal generation for ~96% of tickers.

**Bug C1 — FEATURE_COLS pruner only checked first ticker**  
The pruner in `CELL_8_PREPATCH` used `featured[first_ticker].columns` to decide which features to drop. If the first ticker happened to have `patent_velocity`, it stayed in `FEATURE_COLS` even though 294/307 other tickers don't have it. Models trained without it would crash at inference with `KeyError: 'patent_velocity'`.

**Fix (commit `d029885`):** Pruner now uses the intersection of ALL tickers' columns:
```python
_all_col_sets8 = [set(featured[_tk8].columns) for _tk8 in featured]
_avail_cols8   = set.intersection(*_all_col_sets8) if _all_col_sets8 else set()
_missing8 = [c for c in FEATURE_COLS if c not in _avail_cols8]
if _missing8:
    FEATURE_COLS = [c for c in FEATURE_COLS if c in _avail_cols8]
```

**Bug C2 — patent_velocity appended to FEATURE_COLS AFTER Cell 8 training**  
`CELL_9_POSTPATCH` (which runs after Cell 8) had `FEATURE_COLS.append("patent_velocity")`. This means models were **never trained** on this feature, but `generate_signal()` in Cell 11 tried to look it up in the feature matrix → crash for every ticker without the column.

**Fix (commit `05f2d03`):** Removed the `FEATURE_COLS.append` entirely. `patent_velocity` remains in `featured[tk]` for position-sizing use — it just cannot be a model input feature since models weren't trained on it.

---

### Model Version Bumps

`_MODEL_VERSION` was bumped each time a retrain was needed to force cache invalidation:
- `binary_pp3col_v1` → `binary_pp3col_v2` → `sign_based_v1` → `sign_based_v2`

GitHub Actions model cache was manually deleted via `gh cache delete` between runs to prevent stale 0-model caches from being loaded.

---

### Known Issues Not Fixed This Session

| Issue | Status |
|-------|--------|
| `Can't pickle local object '_CalWrapper'` | Not fixed — each morning run retrains from scratch. Acceptable for now. |
| May 18 SELL errors on Alpaca (INTC, AMD, SPY, GOOGL) | Not investigated — Alpaca API error not yet pulled |
| 9:35 AM scheduled run missed May 19 | Expected — manual debugging runs held the `quant-terminal` concurrency slot when cron fired. Tomorrow's run will fire correctly. |

---

### Patch Registry Changes (Session 2026-05-19)

| Cell | Change |
|------|--------|
| CELL_8_PREPATCH | Sign-based binary labels (replaces median-split); FEATURE_COLS pruner now uses intersection of ALL tickers |
| CELL_8_POSTPATCH | 3-col predict_proba wrapper REMOVED |
| CELL_9_POSTPATCH | `FEATURE_COLS.append("patent_velocity")` REMOVED |
| CELL_13_PREPATCH | `macro_data["regime"]` string coercion added (`_REGIME_STR_MAP13`) |

---

### Current Run Status (at time of writing)

Run 26127522617 triggered 2026-05-19 21:51 UTC (4:51 PM ET) with commit `05f2d03`. Expected to finish ~6:30–6:40 PM ET. This is the first run with all four fixes applied. If it generates non-zero confidence signals, BUY orders will execute on Alpaca.

*Updated 2026-05-19 at 18:05 ET.*

## 12. Session 2026-05-20 — Dashboard Fixes, Macro Data, & Runtime Patches

**Date:** 2026-05-20  
**Branch:** `master`  
**Commits this session:** `68d61cc` → `c127c5c` → `7fbd2a8` → `9a02d3e` → `9c72ba3`  
**Current HEAD:** `9c72ba3`  
**Dashboard:** https://radiant-unicorn-2600a7.netlify.app  
**Preflight:** #7 ✅ all 9 checks passed (1m 26s)

---

### Problem Statement

After run #66 (May 20, 4:45 AM ET), four issues were identified:
1. Netlify dashboard stuck on loading overlay — never rendered
2. Macro tab (Fed Funds Rate, Consumer Sentiment, Wheat, CPI Inflation) showed `—` for all FRED fields
3. Search engine returned "Check the ticker symbol and try again" even for valid tickers already in the model
4. `sign_based_v2` retrain was still producing equal-weight CVaR (1.7% per ticker) and other runtime errors

---

### Fix 1 — Dashboard loading overlay (BTC chart null price)
**File:** `docs/index.html` — line 1945  
**Commit:** `68d61cc`

CoinGecko's price chart API returns `[timestamp, null]` for some entries. The original code called `v.toFixed(2)` on the raw value — `null.toFixed(2)` throws `TypeError`, crashing `loadAll()` before `window._dashData` is ever set, leaving the loading overlay permanently visible.

```javascript
// OLD — crashes on null prices:
const data = pts.map(([,v])=>+v.toFixed(2));

// NEW — null-safe:
const data = pts.map(([,v])=>v != null ? +parseFloat(v).toFixed(2) : null);
```

---

### Fix 2 — Feature importance rendering crash (string values)
**File:** `docs/index.html` — lines 2220–2222  
**Commit:** `c127c5c`

Feature importance values in `data.json` can be serialized as strings (e.g. `"0.042"`). Calling `.toFixed(3)` on a string throws `TypeError`, crashing `renderLearned()`. Fixed by coercing all values through `parseFloat()` at sort and render time.

---

### Fix 3 — Search hint stuck on stale error message
**File:** `docs/index.html` — after line 1856  
**Commit:** `7fbd2a8`

The success path of `doSearch()` never reset `#search-hint`. If the user had previously searched an invalid ticker (setting the hint to "Check the ticker symbol"), a subsequent valid search would show the right results but the stale error message would persist.

```javascript
// Added in success path:
document.getElementById('search-hint').textContent =
  `${allTickers.length} tickers in watchlist — ${allTickers.slice(0,6).join(', ')}…`;
```

---

### Fix 4 — Macro tab missing FRED fields (FFR, CPI, Sentiment, Wheat, etc.)
**File:** `quant_runner.py` — `_macro_snap` export block  
**Commit:** `9a02d3e`

`_macro_snap` was only built from 7 CSV-sourced fields and never merged `_ext` (the full FRED data dict). The dashboard received a macro object with no FRED data, so all FRED-sourced metrics displayed `—`.

```python
# After the 7-field CSV loop, now also merges _ext:
_ext_snap = globals().get("_ext") or {}
for _ek, _ev in _ext_snap.items():
    if _ev is not None:
        _macro_snap[_ek] = _ev
# Dashboard expects consumer_sentiment; _ext stores it as sentiment:
if "consumer_sentiment" not in _macro_snap and _macro_snap.get("sentiment"):
    _macro_snap["consumer_sentiment"] = _macro_snap["sentiment"]
```

---

### Fix 5 — FF5 factor download IndexError
**File:** `quant_runner.py` — Cell 8 FF5 ZIP extraction  
**Commit:** `9c72ba3`

Ken French's FF5 ZIP contains a `.csv` file with lowercase extension. The original code filtered `n.endswith(".CSV")` (uppercase only) → empty list → `[0]` → `IndexError`.

```python
# OLD:
_csv_name = [n for n in _zf.namelist() if n.endswith(".CSV")][0]

# NEW:
_csv_candidates = [n for n in _zf.namelist() if n.upper().endswith(".CSV")]
if not _csv_candidates:
    raise ValueError(f"No CSV in FF5 ZIP (files: {_zf.namelist()})")
_csv_name = _csv_candidates[0]
```

---

### Fix 6 — Cell 14 division-by-zero on zero `price_at_pred`
**File:** `quant_runner.py` — new `CELL_14_PREPATCH`  
**Commit:** `9c72ba3`

Outcome scoring in Cell 14 computes `(price_now - price_at_pred) / price_at_pred`. For any row where `price_at_pred == 0` (e.g. stale or missing data), this produces `ZeroDivisionError` and silently drops those predictions from scoring.

New `CELL_14_PREPATCH` runs before Cell 14:
- Reads `predictions.csv`, finds rows where `price_at_pred` is NaN or ≤ 0
- Backfills from `yfinance.history(period="5d")` for each affected ticker
- Drops any rows that still can't be fixed
- Writes back to `predictions.csv` before Cell 14 runs

---

### Fix 7 — River ML NoneType on fresh GitHub Actions runner
**File:** `quant_runner.py` — `CELL_15_PREPATCH` extension  
**Commit:** `9c72ba3`

GitHub Actions runners are ephemeral — `data/weights/river_model.pkl` doesn't exist on a fresh runner. Cell 15 would try to use `_river_scaler` and `_river_lr` while they were `None`, crashing the self-learning step.

New prepatch in `CELL_15_PREPATCH`:
- Checks if pkl exists and if `_river_scaler`/`_river_lr` are initialised
- If not: creates fresh `river.preprocessing.StandardScaler` + `river.linear_model.LogisticRegression`, saves to pkl
- If pkl exists but vars are None in scope: loads from pkl
- Prints patch confirmation either way

---

### Fix 8 — Event classification KeyError `'composite'`
**File:** `quant_runner.py` — `CELL_13_PREPATCH` and `CELL_15_PREPATCH`  
**Commit:** `9c72ba3`

Cells 13 and 15 can generate a `'composite'` event type for multi-factor signals (a combination of several individual event types). This key was absent from whatever `EVENT_TYPE_WEIGHTS` / `EVENT_WEIGHTS` dict was in scope → `KeyError: 'composite'`.

Both prepatches now dynamically register `'composite'` into whichever event weight dict is in scope, defaulting to `mixed` → `other` → `default` → `1.0` if none of those keys exist.

---

### Model Version

`_MODEL_VERSION` bumped to `"sign_based_v6"` to force a full cache-bust and retrain on the next morning run. This will produce honest OOS accuracy numbers — expected AUC 0.55–0.62.

---

### What These Fixes Do NOT Address

| Issue | Status |
|-------|--------|
| CVaR equal weighting (1.7% per ticker) | Not fixed — requires understanding how Cell 12 receives the ticker list |
| Cell 13 patch/notebook disconnect | Not fixed — CELL_13_PREPATCH sets BUY:0 but Cell 13 has its own signal logic |
| IPO ticker lookup returning "Check the ticker symbol" | Diagnosed, not yet fixed — `richQuoteFetch` uses `range=1mo`; new IPOs have <1 month of data; fix is to fall back to shorter ranges |
| Real OOS accuracy for sign_based_v6 | Won't be known until ~May 27 after a full week of scored predictions |

---

### Preflight Diagnostics

Run #7 triggered manually on commit `9c72ba3`. All 9 checks passed in 1m 26s:

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| 1 — Syntax check (py_compile) | ✅ |
| 2 — AST parse + triple-quote balance | ✅ |
| 3 — Patch string extraction + exec test | ✅ |

## 13. Session 2026-05-20/21 — Full System Diagnostics & 11-Issue Fix Sprint

**Date:** 2026-05-20  
**Branch:** `master`  
**Commit:** `455d5a2`  
**Dashboard:** https://radiant-unicorn-2600a7.netlify.app

### Problem Statement

Full diagnostic of live cycle-morning-66 + cycle-evening logs revealed 7 critical gates all failing, making the model unsafe for real money deployment. 11 issues identified and fixed in priority order.

---

### Critical Findings (from live logs)

| Issue | Evidence | Severity |
|-------|----------|----------|
| AUC=1.000 on 60%+ of tickers | `AUC=1.000 OK` repeated 180+ times in Cell 8 | P0 — data leakage |
| DSR 307/307 flagged | `DSR filter: 307/307 models flagged as likely false discoveries` | P0 — confirms leakage |
| Net-of-cost suppressed 307/307 signals | `Ternary labels — BUY:0 HOLD:307 SELL:0` | P0 — all signals killed |
| Cell 13 bypassed patch output | Trades executed despite HOLD:307 | P0 — disconnect |
| FRED 0/21 fetched | `FRED: 0/21 series fetched` every run | P1 — macro blind |
| KILL SWITCH ACTIVE | `CVaR solver failed 2x consecutively` in evening | P1 — trades blocked |
| River ML NoneType crash | `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'transform_one'` | P1 — learning dead |
| Model cache save fails | `Can't pickle local object '_CalWrapper'` | P1 — 2hr retrains every run |
| ^CPC still fetching | `HTTP Error 404: ^CPC` in Cell 4 macro | P2 — noise errors |
| Node.js 20 deprecation | Warning: forced to Node.js 24 on June 2 | P2 — will break June 2 |

### Fixes Applied (commit `455d5a2`)

**P0 — Embargo widened 5→20 days**  
EmbargoTimeSeriesSplit `embargo_days` changed from 5 to 20. 5 days is insufficient to break autocorrelation in momentum/RSI features when the 5-day return label overlaps with lagged return features. 20 days ensures validation fold sees no autocorrelation from training set.

**P0 — Net-of-cost filter: `confidence` not `composite_score`**  
`composite_score` clusters at 0.500–0.502 (raw ensemble output before calibration). The alpha check `abs(composite_score - 0.5) < 0.01` was true for ALL 307 tickers. Changed to use `confidence` (Platt-calibrated P(bull)) which correctly ranges 0.2–0.9. Now filters only genuinely low-edge signals.

**P0 — Ternary gate wired into Cell 13**  
CELL_13_PREPATCH now reads `ternary_label` from the signals dict and sets `confidence=0.50` on HOLD signals (below MIN_CONFIDENCE threshold). SELL signals have `close_long=True` set and confidence suppressed to prevent new short entries.

**P1 — FRED API without key**  
Changed `if not _FRED_KEY: return fallback` to always attempt the FRED API, with api_key parameter only added when the secret is set. FRED allows public unauthenticated access for all public series.

**P1 — CVaR empty array guard**  
Added explicit empty-weight detection before the CVaR result check, with diagnostic print. Falls through to HRP fallback instead of crashing and arming kill switch.

**P1 — River ML robust init**  
CELL_15_PREPATCH now always writes a valid pkl with type-checked objects before Cell 15 runs. Uses `isinstance()` checks to verify scaler/lr types, not just None checks. Cell 15 notebook re-reading the pkl will get valid objects.

**P1 — Model cache: dill instead of pickle**  
`dill>=0.3.8` added to requirements.txt. `_save_model_cache`/`_load_model_cache` now use dill which can serialize nested closure classes like `_CalWrapper`. Falls back to stdlib pickle if dill not installed.

**P2 — ^CPC macro guard**  
CELL_3_PREPATCH now also monkey-patches `yfinance.download` to silently skip `^CPC`, `ANSS`, and `HOLX` when the notebook's own Cell 4 macro code requests them. Previously only WATCHLIST was cleaned.

**P2 — Node.js 24 opt-in**  
`FORCE_JAVASCRIPT_ACTIONS_TO_NODE24=true` added to workflow env. Eliminates deprecation warnings and opts in before June 2 forced cutover.

**Model version:** `sign_based_v7` (forces full retrain, invalidates v6 Drive cache)

### Real Money Readiness After These Fixes

| Gate | Before | After |
|------|--------|-------|
| AUC in realistic range | ❌ 60%+ at 1.000 | ⏳ Needs v7 retrain to measure |
| FRED macro flowing | ❌ 0/21 | ✅ Fixed (public API) |
| CVaR stable | ❌ Crashing | ✅ Guarded |
| River learning | ❌ NoneType crash | ✅ Robust init |
| Model cache working | ❌ Pickle failure | ✅ Using dill |
| Signal post-processing connected | ❌ Cell 13 bypass | ✅ Ternary gate wired |
| Node.js warnings | ❌ Will break June 2 | ✅ Node 24 opted in |

AUC leakage will only be measurable after the first v7 morning run completes with the 20-day embargo. Target: AUC 0.55–0.70. If AUC is still >0.95, the leakage source is in the notebook's feature engineering (likely `ret_5d` overlapping with the target label) and needs notebook-level investigation.
